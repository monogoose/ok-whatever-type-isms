					    <strong>entry: internet nostalgia</strong>
					    <br>
					    <p>kinda thinking about how flipnote hatena from 2011 to 2013 made me who i am today</p>

					<p>thinking i got into animes like nichijou through that service,, as well as like the touhou franchise and vocal synth culture through flipnotes as well,, i was partially swayed by the music but a lot of that general stuff developed like crazy for me in the coming years and now i’m like the 2011-2013 version of myself times like 1000</p>
					
					<p>if i never learned how to import japanese flipnotes onto my dsi at the time,, i think i’d be like an insanely different person now,, like night and day differences of character</p>
					
					<p>actually it’s cuz of that that i’d also think about,, like,, how much i was influenced by old japanese internet in general,,</p>
					
					<p>flandre scarlet freaked me out as a kid the way she was usually portrayed</p>
					
					<p>stop nagging me with akita neru was like the best song ever at the time (u guys have no idea i had been looking for that song for like at least 10 years i was so desperate but in 2023 i finally found it again like i was so ecstatic and it’s just like ugh it was about as good as i remembered it being in 2013)</p>
					
					<p>there was this one touhou fan song that i really really loved as a kid it went like “pettan pettan tsurupettan” yep i think about it a lot,, i liked tons of fan songs and touhou based content in general back then but like this is what i'm thinking about right now yup</p>
					
					<p>so many catchy songs and substantial pieces of content from back then that kinda give me a weird feeling in my chest thinking about now</p>
					
					<p>why does it make me so nervous lol it’s a little scary</p>

					<p>i think i just miss that time so much it was so special and magic fuck wtf it was beautiful and everything felt like sunshine and rainbows,, especially getting into touhou for the first time,, it weirdly felt so lovely</p>
					
					<p>whatever i’m done being nostalgic i should stop being nostalgic</p>

					<p>the now can be cool too but hey it's not bad to feel nostalgic i guess</p>

					    <strong>entry: ok updates updates updates</strong>
					    <br>
					    <p>okay so some things have happened lately some things that i'm happy about and other things not so much</p>
					    <p>last weekend i went on an unexpected trip to a ferry a few cities from my home and while i was super unprepared and wish i had known in advance that i was going to such a thing i still felt a bit delighted cuz of how lax and lazy the overall trip was i was mellow asf,, tho at the same time it was around the time i started really getting into factorio and i was sliiiightly aching to play that,, but hey i like being out and about so</p>
					    <p>i bought a slim ps1 yesterday like the ones that are stylized as "ps one" and while it iiiis a bit scratched up i still really love just having it around. that's my baby now.. i've never has a ps1 before and now that i own one i'm just so delighted,, i was always skeptical about buying one cuz it's like am i reeeeeally gonna be using this,,, but no i got games for it that i care about and i've even been playing my music cds off it and it's just so amazing i love this purchase</p>
					    <p>at the same time however i tried to buy a ps2 slim on the same day (slight impulse) and when i hooked it up and stuff,, well,, like,, it turned on and everything,, it loaded the browser + config menu just fine,, but it.. didn't want to load the games i had for some reason.. came with a messed up disc drive,, i returned it to the store ofc and while they couldn't give me my money back through cash or to my credit card i still had hella money towards like in-store credit which i of course used up a bit after returning the console,, i ended up getting some games that i'm like so happy to own,, i bought "katamari forever" for the ps3 which btw i'm like the most excited about from my haul today cuz like i love the katamari franchise so much the games are so special and cute and just so substantial, i bought "ape escape" for the ps1 (i don't have the analog ps1 controller for it but i have a ps3 that plays ps1 discs so it's not that big of a deal imo), and i bought this game bundle called "final fantasy chronicles" that had final fantasy iv and "chrono trigger" included which is dope asf,, btw yesterday alongside the ps2, i bought like,, "tony hawk's pro skater" for the ps1 which i think is like awesome,, and like,, wow,, i bought "ICO" for the ps2 do u know how big of a deal that is to me,, ico is in like my top 5 games of all time and now that i own it physically,, it's like,, wow,, i'm winning,, i can look past the north american box art and the fact that i don't currently own a ps2,, i won by owning this,, but for now i'm gonna have to just keep it in the background yk,, like people who buy vinyls without owning a record player,, i don't mind those kinds of people,, i know people tend to mind those kinds of people like so much,, but if u care about the piece of media it's like hey go ahead n make urself feel happy</p>
					    <p>i changed my major back to computer science not too long ago which is like yeah,, i feel i'm more willing and passionate for this now,, i start my summer courses tomorrow which may or may not be a pain cuz i know summer courses are really fast paced and just a potentially big struggle,, but hey outside of college my schedule is free enough for it so,, i'm gonna work thru this</p>
					    <details><summary>potentially sensitive: click to reveal text</summary><p>another thing that happened to me tho which has been sitting on my mind for these past few days is that i got a bunch of really really negative texts from my biological father where he called me slurs in both english and spanish,, and reinstating that i'm to get evicted from my current home pretty soon,, which idk how true that is but i'm keeping my guard up from a distance. really heartbreaking how much my dynamic with him has changed over these past few months,, he would've never said anything like that then,, now he has no problem with me or my sibling committing suicide,, which really strikes a nerve,, if you made it this far     know that i am doing well right now,, physically, mentally,, idk about my housing tho, that's probably a different story,, and yea i still just can't help but think about my recent interactions w him</p></details>    
					    <p>ultimately i'm living my life,, just like everyone else</p>

					    <strong>entry: recent life updates</strong>
					    <br>
					    <p>hi i'm still alive</p>
					    <p>started a new max/msp course recently so that's pretty cool yeah i can't wait to get into that,, would love to perform IDM patches on there once i get better at it,, my cohort has some great progress too like i love spectating it</p>
					    <p>also started an active web dev course alongside the max/msp one cuz i want to take that stuff seriously too,, this website is asking for that kind of love from me</p>
					    <p>before i would very slowly self teach myself these things but now it's like yeah ok cool guided learning,, that's always nice</p>
					    <p>i bought my first otamatone today at a barnes & noble which i'm kinda really happy about cause i'd always wanted to buy one of those but never actively sought out for one cuz it would always slip my mind,, but no yea this is great lol i used to admire them a lot a long long time ago but it's here i own it now and it's so cute it's like a Pusheen edition otamatone i didn't even know those were a thing but amazing.. maybe someday i'll get the miku one</p>
					    <p>and another thing my new 3ds xl had like a corrupted sd card for the past idk maybe 2 or 3 months or so and today i finally said fuck it and reinstated my mod setup and restored to an older nand version which like no yea i'm happy about this too.. albeit some data's gone cuz the nand backup was from like april of last year and i played after that.. but no yea i'm over it i guess it doesn't bother me. i'm also not too bothered over losing like themes and stuff.. all of this is because i already have like a second 3ds with stuff on it so it's like so fine lol</p>
					    <p>gonna go through with changing my college major back to computer science next week cause i've been doing a bunch of thinking these past few months and i'm starting to get the appeal of it again,, i already adopted the major a while back but then opted for natural science cuz at the time i was so disinterested in computer science,, i'm a little heartbroken by that reality nowadays tbh.. but now it's like yeah lol some kind of redemption</p>
					    <p>anyways this is really long</p>
					    <p>i'm happy i think ok life is pretty okay</p>

					    <strong>entry: a bit of an awakening</strong>
					    <br>
					    <p>ok so apparently i do not hate studying.. but the way that i study is slower than i'd wish for it to be</p>
					    <p>answering essay questions seriously helps,, but i feel like i should open myself up to a more constructive workaround than what i'm doing now.. cause i've been answering these with wayyy too many unnecessary words.. i was always an overreacher when it came to writing tbh..,.,. be it for personal or graded purposes.</p>
					    <p>i think i'm starting to get the appeal of cornell note-taking,, although i haven't actually utilized the system in recent history</p>
					    <p>just sounds like a proper format to exercise my knowledge of a subject</p>

					  <br>
					  <p>ngl i jogged for a whole hour straight like nonstop earlier and i honestly have no idea what came over me that made me do that</p>
					  <p>i haven't had tht kind of energy in so long it was honestly a tad bit insane</p>
					  <p>i used to do nonstop 70 minute jogs back in like late 2022 but ,, not at all after that ,, and i was so sure i had fallen off cuz i'd only be getting like 40 min 45 min jogs nowadays ,, but like no i guess we're back lol.. maybe,,,,,</p>
					  <p>i had LUNA SEA's music in my ears while jogging & i think that made it so much more euphoric</p>
					  <p>i love LUNA SEA so much they're amazing visual kei.. top 10 personal discoveries of 2024</p>
					  <p>u know what... i'm recommending them in my <a href="blog.html" class="inline">music page</a> after i'm done writing this</p>
					  <p>anyways i'm gonna watch the minecraft movie tomorrow (later today i guess) w my sibling i think</p>
					  <p>it's gonna suck but at the same time it's gonna be so awesome</p>
					  <p>how semi wonderful</p>
