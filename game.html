					<p><strong>DISCLAIMERS:</strong></p>
					<p>•an asterisk (*) at the beginning of a log signifies that the given date is a rough estimate</p>
					<p>•a tilde (~) symbol at the beginning of a log signifies that the recorded event likely occurred a few days earlier than listed (e.g. a save file made early in my playthrough for a game is listed as 31 December 2020 in the game and will be mentioned on this log page, but since the actual day when i started the game was probably a few days before that, it will be logged with a tilde (~) symbol)</p>
					<p>•the right arrow (→) symbol between two platform names signifies that a game is played on non-native hardware (e.g. emulation, simulation)</p>
					<p>•a game is "revisited" if i play it on a different platform than the previous listed entries for the first time</p>
					<p>•<strong>this page doesn't include every single game that i've played in my entire life!!!</strong> although the goal is to log as much from my history as possible, i'm not gonna be able to remember absolutely EVERYTHING.. nor do i have the willpower to do something like that tbh... i simply did my best remembering events and looking through old devices, accounts, purchase receipts, etc.</p>
