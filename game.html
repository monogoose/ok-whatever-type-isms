					<p><strong>notes:</strong></p>
					<p><i>+i got the wii play dates from the wii message board on my very very old wii that i love oh so much</i></p>
					<p><i>+i got the ios play dates from like the little apps page in the app store account menu</i></p>
					<p><i>+an asterisk (*) at the beginning of a log signifies that the given date is a rough estimate</i></p>
					<p><i>+this obviously doesn't include every single game that i've ever played in my entire life... i simply did my best remembering logs and looking through old devices, accounts, purchase receipts, etc.</i></p>
